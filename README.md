# Udacity Feed Reader Testing Project

The goal of this project is to write a suite of tests to ensure that an RSS feed reader is correctly displaying the links provided in the feeds given to it.
Additionally, the behavior of the menu button is also to be testd.

# How to run the application
Load the index.html file in your browser.
The Jasmine framework will run the tests written and display the result at the bottom of the page. The feedreader.js files contains all the test suites written for this application.
You can change certain values in the app.js files to see the testing process in action.
e.g. try deleting the name or URL property of any of the allFeeds objects; or try changing the value of name or URL to a non string value. The test specs defined in the suite "RSS Feeds" checking the corresponding name or URL will fail.
